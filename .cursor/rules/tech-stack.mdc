# Your rule content

First of all isk anything about WEB3 so if i have to grab anything outside from this area like the Secret keys you have to mention where do i get it and how can i get it Don't forget those things.

Secondly the current project structure is in the root we having the nextjs project which is the frontend and in the /blockchain folder we having the hardhat configured everything realted to the WEB3 i think so.

For the styling use the tailwindcss and make the UI more appropriate

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
